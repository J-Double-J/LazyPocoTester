# LazyPocoTester

Lazy POCO Tester is a testing package that helps automate testing getters and setters on Plain Old Clr Objects (POCOs) aka Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
Whether you need to ensure that your POCOs are setting and getting a value correctly, or you just want code coverage over all your objects, this tool will help you save time writing those tests.

This package is not intended to do much more than testing simple get/set on fields and properties. It aims to follow valid constraints on JSON deserialization rules as these objects are typically serialized and deserialized
from APIs.
